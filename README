BUILDING RADIUS AUTHENTICATION PLUGIN

To install the Adito RADIUS authentication module in the trunk branch, do the following:

* Run "ant install" in $ADITO_HOME
* Run "ant install" in this directory.
* Re-run "ant install" in $ADITO_HOME

Or you could also run "ant release" in this directory and upload the "build/release/adito-community-radius.zip"
extension using the extension Manager. You'll need to restart the Adito server after uploading.

USAGE

This is how you use the RADIUS authentication module:

- login as admin
- create a new authentication scheme and attach RADIUS module to it
- put the RADIUS-enabled authentication scheme to the top of the list 
  (should you want that)
- edit RADIUS settings under "System Configuration -> RADIUS" (and possibly
  restart)
