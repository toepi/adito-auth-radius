This RADIUS module has static libraries in "private" directory. If the dependencies are ever updated through pom.xml and an API change
occurs, the extension will fail to work. The static libraries in "private" should be replaced with libraries fetched using
maven-dependency-plugin. See "agent-assembly" module for an example.

Also, the jradius and jradius-dictionary dependencies are of unknown, old version. The later versions available from public repositories
do not work (=compile fails). The code should be upgraded to make use of the newest jradius API.
